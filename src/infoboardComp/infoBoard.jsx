                advice regularly to see if it’s safe to ship or collect items.

                <h3 className="shipping_head2">Combine trips</h3>
                <p className='shipping_para2'>
                    If your local government guidelines allow you to ship items,
                    then please combine going to the pick-up/drop-off point with
                    a necessary trip (e.g. food shopping or going to the pharmacy).
                    In general, avoid multiple trips out of the house and always follow
                    your local government guidelines on movement.
                </p>
                <h3 className="shipping_head2">Practise social distancing</h3>
                <p className='shipping_para2'>
                    If you leave the house for any reason – including to drop off or
                    pick up parcels – make sure you stay at least 6ft away from other
                    people. Don’t leave the house if you’re feeling unwell. Take extra
                    care if you live with someone in a high-risk group.
                </p>
                <h3 className="shipping_head2">Wash your items</h3>
                <p className='shipping_para2'>
                    As usual, if you’re selling second-hand items always wash them before
                    sending them. If you’ve bought an item, wash it after you receive it.

                <h3 className="shipping_head2">Stay active</h3>
                <p className='shipping_para2'>

                    Vinted is still open for you. If you’re stuck at home,
                    make use of your time and get decluttering! You can chat,
                 list, save favourites, and <Link className='shipping_link'> reserve items.</Link> As always,
                  it’s a good idea to stay in touch with your buyers to
                   let them know what’s happening with their orders.

                <h3 className="shipping_head2">Remember hygiene</h3>
                <p className='shipping_para2'>
                    Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.
                    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Cover your mouth and
                    nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and throw the tissue
                    away immediately and wash your hands straight away afterwards. If
                    you don’t have a tissue to hand, you can use your upper sleeve or
                    the inside of your elbow (not your hands).
                </p>
                <h3 className="shipping_head2">Share facts, not fiction</h3>
                <p className='shipping_para2'>
                    Check the sources of information you get online,
                    through social media, or from family and friends.
                    Please don’t share medical misinformation via messages or

                    If you catch yourself feeling stressed or anxious,
                    consider taking a break from the news and social media.

                    In these times, it’s vital to connect with your community.
                    Look out for your neighbours from afar, and check in with
